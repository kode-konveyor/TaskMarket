   <documentation>Issues for one repository are gathered with GetRepositoryTasksService

Issues can be retrieved according to this documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-repository-issues

The newly obtained tasks are saved in the repository

The status is set by the following rules:
- open issues marked as "up for grab" are UP_FOR_GRAB
- open issues marked as "in progress" are IN_PROGRESS
- other open issues are OPEN
- closed issues are CLOSED


If a github issue has no corresponding task in the list, it is marked with the "not in model" label (if it does not already have it)
