   <documentation>use github api using token authentication

You should set the "Authorization" header to "token my_access_token" as described in https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/

See https://www.baeldung.com/httpclient-custom-http-header for setting the header.

for access token you generate one at https://github.com/settings/tokens with "repo" scope, and put it to the "issuetoken" environment variable.

In Linux you can use your .bashrc to set the environment variable. You can use the command line

    curl -H "Authorization: token $issuetoken" https://api.github.com/repos/kode-konveyor/taskmarket/issues/74

to check your environment.

This service should be integration tested instead of unit testing:

* put the tests under the src/integration-tests hierarchy
* use the @ExcludeFromCodeCoverage annotation on the production service
* no mocking, just calling the service and examining the result
* read the value of the token from the issuetoken environment variable, and put it to the githubToken configuration field in the setUp method.
